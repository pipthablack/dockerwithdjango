## Summary

This code snippet provides instructions for setting up and running a Django project within Docker containers. It includes steps for cloning the repository, building and starting the Docker containers, and accessing the Django application.

### Inputs

- Docker and Docker Compose installed on the system.
- Repository URL to clone the project.
- Configuration files such as `docker-compose.yml` and `.env`.

### Flow

1. Clone the repository to the local machine.
2. Navigate to the project directory.
3. Build and start the Docker containers using `docker-compose up --build`.
4. Access the Django application at `http://localhost:8000`.
5. Interact with the Django admin interface or API endpoints.

### Outputs

- Running Django application accessible at `http://localhost:8000`.
- Docker containers for the Django app and PostgreSQL database.

Django Project with Docker
This repository contains a Django application configured to run within Docker containers. It demonstrates best practices for deploying Django applications using Docker Compose, including database setup, volume management, and environment configuration.

Getting Started
These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development purposes.

Prerequisites
Ensure you have Docker and Docker Compose installed on your system. You can download them from Docker Hub.

Installing :
Clone the repository to your local machine.
Navigate to the project directory.
Build and start the Docker containers by running:
docker-compose up --build

This command builds the images if they don't exist and starts the containers. The application will be accessible at <http://localhost:8000>.

Running the Application
Once the containers are up and running, you can interact with the Django application:

Access the Django admin interface by navigating to <http://localhost:8000/admin>. Use the credentials specified in the .env file or the environment section of the docker-compose.yml file.
Interact with the API endpoints or use the Django shell for further exploration.

Configuration
The docker-compose.yml file configures the following services:

App Service: Builds the Django application image, sets the command to run the server, maps ports, and mounts volumes for data persistence and code changes.
Database Service: Configured to use PostgreSQL. Adjustments can be made in the docker-compose.yml file to switch databases or configure options.
